# Roblabla's config

A slightly modified Ergodox Ez configuration. Here are the main features:

- Removal of the Meh and Hyper keys. I keep hitting hyper instead of b, which
  causes Office to start and take focus. Utterly frustrating.
- Make holding the spacebar send the alt modifier. This allows for a nice alt
  tab shortcut, along with easy access to the menus.
- Add a "French keys" layer, where various french-only keys are stored. To make
  the layer layout-agnostic, it sends Alt-codes. This means it currently only
  works on windows.

# TODO

Support MacOS and Linux, particularly on the french layer. This can be achieved
by having a special "OS selection" key, which would change a global variable.
